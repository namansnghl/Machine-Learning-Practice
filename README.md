# Machine-Learning-Practice
I've curated a collection of hands-on projects spanning from basic to advanced, chronicling my ML journey. Expect regular updates as I continue to add and refine my work.
<ul>
    <li><b> Titanic Dataset</b></li>
	<p> The Titanic dataset is a popular historical dataset available on Kaggle, capturing passenger details from the tragic 1912 voyage. It encompasses features like survival status, class, gender, and age. Frequently used in machine learning, it serves as a foundation for predicting survival outcomes based on passenger characteristics, making it a seminal dataset for data analysis. </p>
	<li><b> Plotly-Dash</b></li>
	<p>Python framework for web apps with dynamic, data-driven visualizations. Simplifies dashboard creation, integrates seamlessly with Python libraries, and offers a declarative syntax for building interactive analytical tools.</p>
</ul>
