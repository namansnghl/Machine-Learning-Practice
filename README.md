I've curated a collection of hands-on projects spanning from basic to advanced, chronicling my ML journey. Expect regular updates as I continue to add and refine my work.

## Titanic Survival Prediction
The [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) is a popular historical dataset available on Kaggle, capturing passenger details from the tragic 1912 voyage. It encompasses features like survival status, class, gender, and age. Frequently used in machine learning, it serves as a foundation for predicting survival outcomes based on passenger characteristics, making it a seminal dataset for data analysis.
